# shinypokemonhunting
use this script and the toggle keys to speed up looking for shiny pokemon! more than 3 times as fast compared to just playing normally

can be used for versions of pokemon with access to a keyboard, in addition keys should be mapped to UP, DOWN, space, and the A buttons
as they show up in the script
